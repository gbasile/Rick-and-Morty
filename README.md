# Rick-and-Morty

This is a project to be used for pairing sessions. 
The application is basically a TabViewController with 2 different tabs: Rick and Morty. 
Each tab implement a CollectionViewController with an hardcoded data source. 

The implementation is really basic and the simplest possible code has been written so 
that there are a lot of possible areas of refactor.

I recommend to ask the candidate to start by creating a generic data source for the 2 CollectionView
